# User conditioning on the web

To begin with the term of operant conditioning has to be defined. In 1937 B. F. Skinner published a research paper in "The Journal of General Psychology" coining the term. His theory is used to describe how behavior is influenced by the rewards and consequences following it. [@operant-conditioning-bfskinner]

For this research paper, the scope will be limited to a more focused topic called negative reinforcement. It describes how the behavior of an operant can be influenced by introducing a negative stimulus. Skinner proposed and conducted an experiment in which he placed a rat into a cage. Then, a mild electric shock — the negative stimuli or reinforcer — was introduced. The box also contained a lever which deactivates the electricity. The rat in the experiment quickly learned to press the lever once the stimulus was introduced. Taking it one step further, a lamp was added which turned on just before the actual stimulus was activated and the operant quickly learned to press the button in response to the lamp to avoid the negative reinforcer. There is a more common version of this experiment in which food is released when the lever is pressed. This describes the opposite kind of conditioning and is called positive reinforcement.

To explain why negative reinforcement might be affecting users on the web, a clearer picture of how websites are handling consent is required. Users have been exposed to privacy policies, cookie notices, and tracking consent mechanisms for a long time [@tfl-3]. However, recently there has been a fundamental change. Up till now, websites were freely accessible and such mechanisms only occupied a limited portion of the screen. This changed with recent legislation, making it mandatory to collect consent before actually tracking the visitors. To get an insight into how this affected access to websites, a small analysis will be conducted.

First, a list of the top 300 domains has been retrieved from a large SEO contractor [@moz-list]. Since the web is changing every day, a snapshot of this list at the time of writing has been included in the accompanying GitHub repository^[Link excluded in this version of the document]. Second, each of these websites has been visited from within Europe^[To rule out any potential regional variations in the websites] and manually categorized as follows. There are categories and subcategories. Categories describe the type of consent mechanism in place (Modal, Banner, Other) and subcategories describe the subtype of mechanism. For banners and modals there are three types:

**Info:** The consent mechanism is only informing the user about the collection of data and does not present a choice. Some variations may ask the user to leave the page if they do not consent.

**Config:** An option to manually configure which data can be tracked is present, however, users can not reject all tracking with a single click.

**Reject:** Users are presented with a direct option to reject tracking. This subtype may also include a config option but it is possible to reject with a single click.

For the "Other" category there are three subcategories:

**Nothing:** No consent mechanism is present. This may not indicate that the page is not tracking the user regardless.

**Blocked:** The page is regionally blocked within Europe, preventing access in regions where the new legislation is in effect.

**Invalid:** There is no valid web-content behind the domain name. This has been the case for content delivery networks, services, and others. It does not indicate that the domain has no content, just that there is no publicly visible content.

<!-- TODO Write this in reflection: "A word of warning: The results collected and displayed in [@fig:website-stats] have been evaluated by a single individual, have not been reviewed by others, and only include the 300 most common domains. They may only be taken as a rough estimate and may not be interpreted in detail or taken as representative for the whole web without caution or manual review!" -->

The pie chart seen in [@fig:website-stats] contains the previously mentioned categories and subcategories. The former are identified by the groups of colors (green, orange, grey) while the latter is represented by different shades of the aforementioned colors. Looking at the "Other" shard it becomes immediately obvious that over a third of all pages do not present any kind of consent mechanism or are regionally unavailable. Note that it has not been evaluated whether or not pages in this category are still tracking users. To answer this further research is required. Looking at the other two categories, banners do prevail with 32% over 25% of pages with modals. However, almost half of the banners do not ask for consent but instead only inform the users that tracking takes place. With modals, the story is slightly different. Two websites did solely inform the user while an overwhelming majority of modals are presenting a complex configuration menu which requires at least three clicks to reject tracking. Only six domains did provide a modal with a one-click method to do so.

Looking back at operant conditioning, a quarter of all websites have become obstructed by a consent workflow out of which almost 90% makes it very complicated and time-consuming to visit the website without being tracked. In this instance, the consent flow can be seen as a negative stimulus that prevents the user from accessing the desired content. Research has revealed that humans are likely to prefer immediate stimuli that only last for a short time period and have shown impulsive behavior while influenced by a negative reinforcer [@impulsive-humans-under-reinforcement]. This knowledge is being used by todays consent workflows which provide an easy, short route of evading the stimuli by agreeing to data collection while making it complicated and time-consuming to disallow tracking. Whether or not this is a deliberate act or a coincidence is unclear. However, websites could very well have designed modals in a way that favors disallowing and makes selectively agreeing to certain tracking providers the more complex option. This not being the case on every website observed makes a strong argument for it being a deliberate choice^[Further research is required to definitively prove this]. Overall, it seems very likely that users are being influenced through negative reinforcement by the new consent mechanisms. Old, banner-style consent mechanisms are less likely to have this effect since the stimulus is too weak and a majority of people are ignoring them altogether [@tfl-3].
