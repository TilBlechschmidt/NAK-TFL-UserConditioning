# Survey

Now that we are familiar with conditioning and why it might apply in the context of the web, we have to find evidence that it applies in the real world. There are two factors we will look at in this paper. The first one focuses on whether or not users do consider the content of privacy-related modals or act based on assumptions and prior knowledge. The second aspect is whether or not users are consistently choosing one strategy to deal with such modals. If some users (which ideally consider themselves privacy-aware) always reject the policies while others always accept it, it could indicate a strategy based on a real preference. However, if users vary frequently between strategies and for example abandon the rejection of a policy, if the process is too complicated, it would indicate that decisions are not solely based on the users' preference.

As this is a topic that heavily relies on the users' psychology a plain interview is out of the question. While it is likely possible to design an interview so it would yield reasonable results, there are easier methods available. As user preference plays a big role a sufficient number of participants is required. This makes an interactive survey an attractive choice as it can be scaled effortlessly. To answer the initial questions we have to collect some data during the survey and control a few factors listed below:

**User interaction:** To determine whether or not the user follows a consistent strategy we have to observe the path he takes through the modals on various websites. This can be realized by either tracking all JavaScript events fired within the browser or by recording the screen and visualizing touch/mouse interactions and reviewing it later.

**Browser control:** To consistently display websites to all participants and make sure the same privacy policy modals show up, some degree of control has to be exerted over either the websites or the browser^[Note that some websites share the same service provider for modals and answering a modal on one page might hide it on another one (NextRoll, Inc. is an example for one such provider)!].

**Page control:** Verifying whether or not users consider the content of privacy modals requires modifications to such modals — more on that in the design phase. This requires writing access to a website's source code or access to the browser to display a fake website^[As one can expect, this is considered a major security concern under real-life circumstances and thus not easy to achieve].

The above criteria leave a couple of options with varying complexity. The conceptually simplest would be to modify an existing website that has live traffic. However, this option requires access to such a page and legal constraints make this unviable. Another option would be to implement a proxy server that filters and modifies traffic to create a sculpted scenario as required for this survey. Again, this requires consent from the users, modifications to the operating system of the participants, and therefore scaling is hard to achieve. The widespread adoption of traffic encryption further complicates this option. That leaves one more option, running the survey on a device that has been prepared and configured specifically for this survey. Screen recording and visualization of user interactions can be achieved easily, controlling the browser is possible and depending on the operating system it is viable to trick the browser into displaying a fake website. However, this approach does not scale very well as it requires one-on-one interaction with each participant. To circumvent this issue, a purpose-built mobile application for tablets could be developed. It provides all the options available with the single-device approach and makes distribution and thus scaling easy. As an additional bonus, it reduces the number of health precautions required because human interaction is reduced.

## Design

This subsection covers various design decisions made for both the app containing the survey as well as the survey workflow itself.

### Application

Due to prior knowledge with iOS app development, availability of appropriate devices, and the availability of APIs that cover all requirements, the Apple iPad has been chosen as the survey platform. An interactive survey application has been developed. The [ResearchKit](http://researchkit.org) framework has been employed to simplify the creation of a survey workflow. Browser automation and control has been implemented using the [WebKit](http://webkit.org) framework. Other UI components including a frontend for the browser have been implemented using the [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) and [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) system libraries. Screen recording has been implemented using the `RPScreenRecorder` class from [ReplayKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/replaykit) and H.265 encoding of the resulting frames was done using the `AVAssetWriter` from [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avassetwriter). The data from both ResearchKit (participants answers to questions, duration of tasks) and AVFoundation (screen recordings) are being bundled as a [tar ball](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tar) using the [SWCompression](https://github.com/tsolomko/SWCompression) framework. This file will be sent to the authors through the Telegram app using a specialized UI component. The source code of this application together with all scripts used for evaluation is available on GitHub^[The link has been excluded from this version of the document to retain the anonymity of the author].

### Workflow

The survey begins by introducing the authors and why this survey is being conducted. Then, the user is notified about the types of data being collected and that he can cancel at any time. Next, the participant is asked whether his data may be shared publicly. The data of all participants that agreed to this will be published in the previously mentioned GitHub repository. After that, the user is requested to start the screen recording using a system dialog. Now the user is introduced to the concept of assignments and how to solve them (rough explanation of the user interface). What follows is several tasks that require the participant to interact with various websites. These have been designed to distract from the actual focus of the survey and the answers to these are not being stored or validated. To prevent interference through factors like annoyance their order will be randomized for each participant. One task involves a website that has been rigged to include a bogus privacy policy text that makes the user sell his kidney. While not legally valid, this makes it easy to check later if the user noticed this fake policy. There are six assignments as previous surveys have shown that a higher number makes the overall survey too long. The goal is for the survey to take roughly eight minutes. Once all assignments have been completed the user is asked a few questions:

- Data privacy
  - How important is data privacy to you on a scale from 1 to 10?
  - Does the GDPR improve the privacy of your data?
  - Do you usually try to get rid of modals or configure them according to your preference?
  - Did you notice that you sold your left kidney?
- Demography
  - What describes your occupation best? [School, University, Work, Pensioned]
  - Are you working in the computer science sector?
  - How good are your computer skills on a scale from 1 to 10?

Finally, the user is given the option to share his contact information to be notified about the results.

### Websites & Assignments

Regarding websites, five german pages with modal privacy policy popups have been chosen at random. These include Heise ([https://heise.de](https://heise.de)), UCI ([https://uci-kinowelt.de](https://uci-kinowelt.de)), Postillon ([http://der-postillon.com](http://der-postillon.com)), famila ([http://famila.de](http://famila.de)) and ING-DiBa ([https://ing.de](https://ing.de)). To forge a modal, a small British web-shop selling wooden ducks called Dcuk ([https://dcuk.com](https://dcuk.com)) has been selected — the forged modal can be seen in [@fig:website-dcuk]. The assignments and consent mechanism designs are listed below, screen captures of each page can be found in the Appendix ([@sec:screen-caps]).

**Heise:** This page contains a large, colored accept button and a transparent but outlined configure button side by side. The latter leads to a rather simple configuration menu with only a few switches. However, it theoretically requires only two clicks to reject the policy. The assignment on this page is to find the duration of the trial for their premium news subscription service called "Heise+".

**UCI:** As opposed to Heise, the consent modal contains three buttons. The first one accepts the policy, the second rejects it, and the third opens a complex configuration menu. They are vertically stacked and have decreasing highlights with the first one having a prominent background color, the second one is just text, and the third one is small text. Participants have to find the monthly price of the cinema subscription called "UCI Unlimited".

**Postillon:** The modal of this page is larger than the other two and contains a filled accept button and an outlined configure button. The configuration menu is rather complex with multiple tabs and hundreds of switches. Rejecting the policy technically takes two clicks, however, users might be tricked into pressing an "Accept All" button in the bottom right of the config interface. To fulfill the assignment, the name of the author of the first edition has to be found.

**famila:** Of all pages, this is probably the most straightforward. The modal contains three checkboxes for different tracking sources, a accept all button, and a button to save the selected ones where the default is to reject all non-necessary cookies. The reject/save button is grey while the accept button is green and they are vertically stacked. Users have to find the name of the head of operations at their closest store.

**ING-DiBa:** This page contains a modal that has a filled orange accept button in the bottom right and a text-based config button in the bottom left. The settings are rather straightforward and it requires two clicks to reject the policy. The assignment on this page involves finding the minimum monthly salary required for the personal bank account to be free.

**Dcuk:** The consent mechanism of this page has been forged to look authentic. The website is loaded by the bookmark is not the remote page but instead a local HTML file containing an iframe. Once the content of the frame has finished loading, a forged overlay will be shown by local JavaScript. It can be seen in [@fig:website-dcuk] and the source code is available in the previously mentioned GitHub repository. To complete the task, the user has to find the price of a so-called "Graduation Dinky Duck".

## Distribution

Now that we have determined that a survey is the method of choice, we are going to implement and distribute it. As it is an iPadOS app there are limited distribution options available. Publishing it to the App Store publicly is not viable since it does not align with some of the stores' review guidelines and contains personal contact information of the authors. An alternative is the [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com) service. It provides a way to distribute an app to up to 10.000 beta testers using just a link. This link can then be distributed to personal contacts which in turn distribute it to their peers with appropriate devices. People that have the application installed on their device can in turn have other acquaintances go through the survey. As there are no other simpler solutions available^[At least with the limited research done] and since this approach is rather straightforward it will be used. Throughout two weeks data will be collected with a goal of equal to or greater than 20 participants. Past surveys have shown this number to be a reasonable expectation for the collection period and while it does not produce representative results it suffices to provide a rough idea of what representative results may look like^[Which, given the scope of both length and time of this research paper, is acceptable].
