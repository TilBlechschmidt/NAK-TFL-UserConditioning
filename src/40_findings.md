# Findings

The survey has been conducted over a time period of 15 days and a total of 26 results have been collected. Out of those, one participants result was unusable due to file corruption during the screen recording. A total of 19 participants gave consent to share their results with the public and the corresponding data can be found in the accompanying GitHub repository^[Link excluded in this version of the document].

## Overall

Even though the overall results may not give direct insights into the conditioning status of participants, it may still contain valuable insights. The average duration of the survey was just over eight minutes, closely matching the original goal. Regarding the GDPR 42% (11) of the participants would consider it an improvement to data privacy while 58% state that it did not make any significant impact. Out of all privacy policies shown, 59% (89) have been accepted and 41% (61) rejected. However, the ratio varies heavily between pages with famila and the UCI clocking in at 32% and 48% of accepted policies respectively while pages like Heise and ING-DiBa are closer to 75% as can be seen in [@fig:actions-taken]. While it is not the goal of this paper to determine differences in design and workflow that influence user behavior, it can be assumed that the simpler rejection path of the former — requiring only a single click — caused these numbers while the more complex workflows and hidden rejection methods on the latter pages eventually forced users into accepting policies. <!-- TODO Cite my own work! Or maybe reference the "survey" done in the conditioning section ;) --> Video recordings also showed some participants attempting to reject policies but were then either tricked into accepting them by presenting an "Accept All" button at the end of the configuration page or having a complex workflow which led to the user backtracking and using the simpler accept workflow. Some users also exhibited patterns of annoyance especially on pages which repeatedly showed the popup after navigation when the cookies were rejected, ultimately accepting the policy.

## Demographics

The group demographics splits into sixteen students and nine persons working full-time. No retired persons or children did participate. The same distribution can be seen in persons working in the software development sector with sixteen doing so and nine working in other areas. Unfortunately, there were not enough participants to make statistically significant statements based on the subjective computer knowledge or privacy importance. However, the diagrams showing the values have been included for completeness and can be found in [@fig:demographics-knowledge] and [@fig:demographics-privacy]. While the number of rejected policies does not deviate significantly between students and employed, the data reveals that students rate the importance of privacy lower than employed participants at $5.5$ vs. $7.\overline{4}$ on a scale from 1 through 10.

## Behavior

First and foremost we will take a look at the fake policy. While it has been rejected by 40% of all participants, it is unlikely that this was due to its actual content. The question at the end of the survey asked participants whether they noticed the fake text. Only one participant confirmed this, however, after reviewing the video footage it seemed unlikely that this person actually did do so. The popup was visible for less than two seconds. After contacting the participant it was revealed to be a mistake and that person meant to answer the question with no. Thus, no participant noticed the bogus text. This stands in stark contrast with subjective user behavior, where 31% claimed to consider the content of such policies. This reveals a discrepancy between the intended and actual behavior. Looking back at demographics, out of eight participants claiming to consider popups, half accepted four or more policies and these individuals valued the importance of privacy around the mid-point of the scale. This might indicate that some persons are infact considering the popups but do knowingly decide to accept the policy. Whether or not this action stems from manipulation or other reasoning can not be determined from the data collected and requires more research.

Next, we will consider the consistency of individuals. For this, a fraction of accepted policies has been calculated for each paritcipant and they have been accumulated in a histogram which can be seen in [@fig:behavior-policies-accepted]. Ten participants (40%) did consistently accept or reject policies. However, 60% did deviate from the extremes at least once with 28% doing so more than once. This indicates that a majority of users may not be following one logical strategy but are re-evaluating each time a website is being visited. With the deviation present it is likely that factors like popup design play a significant role in the users choice. However, further research is required and a previous survey in this series of papers set the stepping stone for that [@tfl-3].

![Behavior when interacting with a policy modal](src/images/behavior.pdf){#fig:behavior}

Finally, lets take a look at indiviuals behavior when interacting with a policy modal. To do so three categories have been defined. The first one is called "Evasive" and describes an interaction where the user dismisses a modal within seconds of it being displayed and do not interact with it in any meaningful way other than executing a single click. The second one is called "Normal" and describes an interaction where the user either takes more than five seconds or deviates from the direct path to dismiss the modal^[Which can be either rejection or accepting. Clicking two buttons in quick succession to reject a policy is still considered "Evasive" if this is the fastest route to reject]. The last one is called "Persistent" and describes an interaction where a user thoroughly inspects a modal by clicking through multiple tabs, toggling multiple switches or taking more than 30 seconds to dismiss it. Each interaction has been categorized and grouped by page. The results are visible in [@fig:behavior]. Note that the last page did not have any advanced configuration menus which might have adversely affected the number of persistent interactions. Overall, only 16% of interactions did not exhibit behavior which has been categorized as "Evasive". It aligns with the results of a survey conducted in 2018 which showed that only ~11% of the participants do read the (+GDPR) terms and conditions before giving consent [@few-users-read-conditions]. This goes to show that a majority of user interactions happened quickly and without much consideration, indicating that users may have been conditioned to recognize the design and structure of privacy policy modals and take action to evade them to reach their desired information.
