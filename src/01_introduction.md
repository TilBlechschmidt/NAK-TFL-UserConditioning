  - Planning
  - Research
- Allowed companies to extend their reach

  - Countless ways to build a website with no right way
  - Number of legal requirements which differ per country
    - Yields region blocked pages
- Has become hard to adhere to all regulations [TODO cite source regarding money companies spend on GDPR]
- GDPR introduced explicit opt-in as opposed to opt-out
  - Interest shifted from making users not notice opt-out
  - Now its about tricking them into opting in
  - Not even their fault, this kind of data is valuable for a business to maintain its online presence and stay competitive
- Cite GDPR which intends for users to establish a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication!
- Research questions
  - How are users being tricked and manipulated to opt-in?
  - Are users consciously making decisions as the GDPR intended to?
