# Conclusion

- Key takeaways
  - TODO
  - Conditioning might not have been intentional by legislation makers, websites are profiting from it, original goal is being missed

- More research
  - Motivation for accepting policies (manipulation, accepting the tradeoff, not caring, "my data is unimportant" etc.)

- Reflection and other noteworthy results
  - Some pages take very long to load their popups (some people almost evaded it)
  - Unstable internet connections caused some issues
  - Most tend to press big flashy buttons
    - Only a few actually take the time to read the buttons, even fewer actually read the content
  - No really consistent behaviour
  - Users still skipped questions to which they knew the answer :(
  - Putting the trick question at the end proved useful, users were annoyed by then
  - Survey might not 100% match
  - Distribution method caused distractions / non-isolated / non-focused environment
  - Data contains lots more details
    - No time/space left to analyse them
    - Survey design allows to pull out interesting details, but participant count is too low
